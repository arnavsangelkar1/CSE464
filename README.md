This code will create a graph as well as add nodes and edges. 
The code will however download the graph into a dot file and can be made into a png with comand line promnt. 
All of the test cases are in the main file. 


What the end project will look like as a png after the command line prompt (dot -Tpng input.dot -o output.png)

Output: It will say that "This node Already Exists *Insert Node*" When there are duplicates as well as with edges. It will output a dot file into the file and then you can use command line to make it a png. 

Here are expected outputs for removing nodes, edges as well as the updated path. The code has algorithim to look at BFS and DFS depending on what the user wants.
