# ProjectPart1
This code will create a graph as well as add nodes and edges. I was unable to add test cases or maven compadability.
The code will however download the graph into a dot file and can be made into a png with comand line promnt. 

What the end project will look like as a png after the command line prompt (dot -Tpng input.dot -o output.png)

I added the pom.xml file that I was working on, but it does not work to compile. I wrote the whole code forgetting to use maven, so when I tried to switch to it and use that to run it it would not work. This is why I have the above output from my code, but I do not have the maven to support or run it.
